# upwelling_projection
Projected upwelling indices (CUTI and BEUTI) from downscaled ocean projections. Upwelling indices are available for 1980-2100 from each of three downscaled projections, forced by different Earth System Models: Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory GFDL-ESM2M, Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace IPSL-CM5A-MR, and Hadley Centre HadGEM2-ES.
